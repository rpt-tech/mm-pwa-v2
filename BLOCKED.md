[2026-02-19 00:09] BLOCKED: husky install hook missing since package not installed
Reason: npm install fails because the post-install Husky hook (`husky install && npm run prepare:hooks`) references `husky` but the mono repo has no husky dependency. Need either to install husky dependency or remove the undefined hook before dependency installation can succeed.
[RESOLVED 2026-02-21] Fixed by: (1) adding guarded `prepare` script in apps/web/package.json that only runs husky when .git exists, (2) switching vercel.json to pnpm install --frozen-lockfile so Vercel no longer triggers the broken npm post-install hook.
